## My process
- Testimonial Page for a Coding Bootcamp
This project is a responsive testimonial page designed for a coding bootcamp. It showcases the experiences and feedback of various graduates, highlighting their successful career transitions and the impact of the bootcamp on their lives. The page layout is created using HTML and styled using CSS.

- Features and Functionality
The page is structured using semantic HTML elements, making it easily readable and accessible.
CSS Grid is utilized to create a responsive and visually appealing layout for the testimonials.
Each testimonial section includes an avatar image, graduate's name, and their feedback statement.
The testimonials are styled with different background colors and images, providing visual variety.
The page is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.
The font used throughout the page is "Barlow Semi Condensed," imported from Google Fonts.
The project includes a favicon and external CSS file for better organization and maintainability.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt more about CSS grids.  Implementing CSS Grid layout enhanced the flexibility and responsiveness of my design. It allowed for easy positioning and alignment of elements in a grid structure.
Some CSS code I'm proud of;

```css
main {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 0.5fr;
    grid-template-areas:
        "box1 box1 box2 box5"
        "box3 box4 box4 box5";
}

```

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    main {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: 1fr .6fr .6fr .8fr 1fr;
        grid-template-areas:
            "box1"
            "box2"
            "box3"
            "box4"
            "box5";
    }
}

```

### Continued development
1. Enhanced Responsiveness: Further improvement of the responsiveness of the testimonial page to ensure optimal viewing on various devices and screen sizes. I feel the need to implement additional media queries or adjust existing ones to refine the layout and styling.

2. Interactive Elements: I want to introduce interactive elements such as hover effects, transitions, or animations to add more interactivity and engagement to the testimonial page.
